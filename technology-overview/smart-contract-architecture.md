# üèó Smart Contract Architecture

* [ ] Marketplace Contract: The main contract that governs the overall functionality of the marketplace. It manages user registration, handles transactions, and enforces marketplace rules. It includes functions for creating and listing AI models, managing payments, and handling reputation and governance mechanisms.
* [ ] AI Model Contract: Each AI model listed on the marketplace can have its own individual smart contract. This contract includes details about the model, such as its description, metadata, pricing, and availability. It allows users to interact with the model, including purchasing access, executing predictions, and providing feedback or ratings.
* [ ] Escrow Contract: A separate contract that acts as an escrow for managing the financial transactions within the marketplace. It holds funds during the transaction process and ensures secure and fair exchanges between buyers and sellers. The escrow contract releases funds to the seller once the transaction is successfully completed or facilitates refunds in case of disputes.
* [ ] Reputation Contract: A contract that tracks and calculates reputation scores for participants within the marketplace. It considers various factors such as user feedback, transaction history, and model performance to determine reputation scores. The reputation contract can be used to establish trust and incentivize high-quality contributions.
* [ ] Governance Contract: A contract that facilitates the governance of the marketplace. It allows token holders to propose and vote on changes to the marketplace's rules, features, or policies. The governance contract ensures transparency and community participation in decision-making processes.
* [ ] Payment Contract: An optional contract that handles cryptocurrency payments within the marketplace. It integrates with cryptocurrency wallets or payment gateways to facilitate secure and seamless transactions using the marketplace's native token or accepted cryptocurrencies. The payment contract ensures proper validation, verification, and recording of transactions.
* [ ] Data Management Contract: A contract responsible for managing the storage, retrieval, and access control of AI models and related data. It integrates with decentralized storage platforms like IPFS or Filecoin to securely store and retrieve AI models while maintaining data privacy and access control.
